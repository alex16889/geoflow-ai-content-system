# GEOFlow Changelog

This document tracks user-facing updates in the public repository. For future GitHub pushes, update this file together with the Chinese version in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 2026-05-27

### Open-source downstream release prep

- Added origin and downstream-development notes while preserving the upstream Apache-2.0 license, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and source author attributions.
- Added `OPEN_SOURCE_RELEASE.md` with the public release boundary, downstream change list, and pre-push checklist.
- Removed fixed default admin password references from public docs and the legacy bootstrap path; use `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` or the generated random initial password instead.
- Updated the admin footer and welcome panel to distinguish upstream source, current repository, and downstream maintenance.
- Added GitHub Actions CI and an open-source release audit covering PHP syntax, Tailwind build, guardrail tests, dependency audit, and sensitive-content scanning.
